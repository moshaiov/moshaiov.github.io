[&#8498 0 Grossman 13] every integer has a light on it. initially all lights are turned off. 2012 people arrive, one after the other. each person chooses 2013 consecutive lamps and switches their states (on$\leftrightarrow$off). let $k$ be the number of lit lamps after everyone's done. show that $k$ is even and no 2013 consecutive lamps contain more than $k/2$ lit lamps. <hr>
[&#8498 1 Putnam 05] let $\#\{(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbf{Z}^n : |x_1|+\dots+|x_n|\le m\}=a_{mn}$. show that $a_{mn}=a_{nm}$. <hr>
[&#8498 2 Putnam 05] find $\displaystyle \sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\dfrac{\text{sgn}(\sigma)}{1+\#\text{fixed points}(\sigma)}$ <hr>
[&#8498 3] you and $n-1$ friends will be put in a room momentarily. you'll be able to see each other. a colour will be drawn on each of your foreheads (for everyone but you to see). then, simultaneously, everyone will specify the number of players with the same colour as them. devise a strategy for at least one of you to get the right answer. <hr>
[&#8498 4] let $(A,B,E)$ be a bipartite graph with $d(a)\ge d(b)$ $\forall a\sim b$. show that $|B|\ge|A|$. <hr>
[&#8498 5 Grossman 11] let $P(x)\in\mathbf{Z}[x]$ be monic. show that $p^2\mid P(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbf{Z}$ $\implies \deg P\ge 2p$. <hr>
[&#8498 6] find an algorithm to determine the second largest key from $x_1,\dots,x_n$ using $n+O(\log n)$ comparisons. (in each comparison you pick two elements and you're told which is larger.) <hr>
[&#8498 7] a bounded harmonic function on $\mathbf{Z}^d$ must be constant. ($f:\mathbf{Z}^d\to\mathbf{R}$ is called harmonic if $\forall x$ $f(x)=\underset{y\sim x}{\text{average}}f(y)$, the average is over the $2d$ neighboring vertices of $x$.) <hr>
[&#8498 8 project Euler 345] describe an algorithm that given an $n\times n$ matrix $M$, finds $\displaystyle\max_{\sigma\in S_n}\sum_j M_{j,\sigma(j)}$ in reasonable time. <hr>
[&#8498 9] consider the following dynamic on a graph. the nodes vote for / against every year. if a node's neighbours were equally divided, the node's vote won't change. if a majority voted $x$, the node will vote $x$. show that the votes are eventually two periodic. <hr>
