[&#8498 1 putnam 05] let $\#\{(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbf{Z}^n : |x_1|+\dots+|x_n|\le m\}=a_{mn}$. show that $a_{mn}=a_{nm}$. <br>
[&#8498 2 putnam 05] find $\displaystyle \sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\dfrac{\text{sgn}(\sigma)}{1+\#\text{fixed points}(\sigma)}$ <br>
[&#8498 3] you and $n-1$ friends will be put in a room momentarily. you'll be able to see each other. a colour will be drawn on each of your foreheads (for everyone but you to see). then, simultaneously you'll each need to specify the number of players with the same colour as you. you win if one of you gets it right. what's your strategy? <br>
