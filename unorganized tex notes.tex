definitions. 
the differentials $\d z$ and $\d\bar z$ are given by $\d z = \d x+i\d y$ and $\d \bar z=\d x - i \d y$. 
the differential operators $\partial,\bar\partial$ are given by $\partial = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_x - i\partial_y)$ and $\bar\partial=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_x + i\partial_y)$.

observations. \\
$\d f=\partial_x f \d x+\partial_y f \d y = \partial f \d z + \bar\partial f \d\bar z$. \\
$f$ satisfies the Cauchy Riemann equations iff $\bar\partial f= 0$. \\
$\d (f \d z)=2i\bar\partial f \d x\wedge\d y$
\\
\\
corollary. let $D$ be a disk, let $f:\bar D\to \C$ be continuous and holomorphic on $D$. then $\oint_{\partial D} f\d z = 0$.



let $x_{n}+1 = x_{n-1}x_{n+1}$. then $x$ has period five.
let $|x_{n}|=x_{n-1}+x_{n+1}$. then $x$ has period nine.
